Some examples of SQL queries I have written.

1. Loose Join - Created a table that maps each unique weather outage location to its nearest weather station to examine the impact of weather on outages. The locations were loose joined using Euclidean distance.
2. Streaming Analysis - Created custom query to analyze data from three different tables to understand streamer and audience interactions.
